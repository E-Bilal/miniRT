 ## miniRT

miniRT is a compact ray tracer developed in C using the minilibx graphics library. The project implements a simplified version of a ray tracing engine capable of rendering 3D scenes composed of basic geometric primitives, 
complete with lighting, shadows, and reflections.

### **Key Features**:

**Ray Tracing Algorithm** <br>
           - Simulates light rays to generate realistic images with accurate lighting effects. 

**** Geometric Primitives: 
    Supports spheres, planes and cylinders.
  
  -Lighting & Shadows
      Implements ambient and specular lighting models.
      Handles shadows and basic reflections.
  
  -Camera & Viewport Control
      Adjustable camera position, orientation, and field of view.
      Interactive viewport manipulation (e.g., zoom, rotation).
  -Scene Configuration
      Parses scene descriptions from .rt configuration files.
      Defines objects, lights, and camera settings via text-based input.
